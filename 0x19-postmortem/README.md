# Postmortem: The Great Nginx Meltdown of 2024

## Issue Summary

**Duration of Outage:**
- **Start Time:** May 15, 2024, 09:00 AM UTC
- **End Time:** May 15, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC

**Impact:**
- **Service Affected:** Our beloved website, serving the finest cat memes and dog videos.
- **User Experience:** Slow load times and frequent errors. Users were left staring at loading spinners instead of adorable animal antics.
- **Affected Users:** Approximately 47% of our user base, which translates to roughly 470,000 devastated pet lovers.

**Root Cause:**
- Nginx server was overwhelmed by a surge of requests, leading to a high number of failed requests due to a misconfigured worker process limit.

## Timeline

- **09:00 AM:** Issue detected via a sudden spike in monitoring alerts indicating increased error rates.
- **09:02 AM:** On-call engineer, Dave, is summoned from his morning coffee by the alert.
- **09:05 AM:** Dave verifies the issue by running ApacheBench, confirming 943 out of 2000 requests failed.
- **09:10 AM:** Assumption made that the issue might be related to recent code deployment.
- **09:15 AM:** Rollback of the latest deployment initiated.
- **09:20 AM:** Rollback completed, but issue persists. Dave's frustration level increases.
- **09:30 AM:** Misleading path: Investigate potential network issues; none found.
- **09:40 AM:** Escalation to the Nginx configuration team.
- **09:45 AM:** Team discovers Nginx worker process limits are too low to handle current traffic.
- **09:50 AM:** Configuration updated to increase worker process limits.
- **09:55 AM:** Nginx server restarted.
- **10:00 AM:** Issue resolved, ApacheBench shows 0 failed requests. Dave finally finishes his now-cold coffee.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**
- The Nginx server was configured with insufficient worker processes, unable to handle the load of 2000 simultaneous requests, leading to a high number of failed requests and non-2xx responses.

**Resolution:**
- Increased the `worker_processes` and `worker_connections` settings in the Nginx configuration. The Puppet script was then used to apply the changes, ensuring they persist across reboots.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**
- Conduct a thorough review of Nginx configurations to ensure they are optimized for high traffic scenarios.
- Enhance monitoring to include alerts for Nginx worker limits approaching capacity.
- Implement automated scaling solutions to handle sudden traffic spikes.

**TODO:**
1. **Patch Nginx Server:**
   - Update Nginx configuration files to set `worker_processes` to `auto`.
   - Set `worker_connections` to a higher value based on server capacity.

2. **Add Monitoring:**
   - Implement monitoring for Nginx worker processes and connections.
   - Set up alerts for when worker processes exceed 80% capacity.

3. **Automate Scaling:**
   - Develop scripts to dynamically adjust Nginx worker limits based on traffic patterns.
   - Integrate these scripts with the deployment pipeline to ensure configurations are always optimal.

4. **Conduct Load Testing:**
   - Schedule regular load tests using ApacheBench or similar tools to validate server capacity.
   - Adjust configurations based on test results to maintain optimal performance.

In conclusion, while our server had a brief meltdown under the pressure of adoring fans eager for their daily dose of cuteness, we've learned valuable lessons and are better prepared for future onslaughts of web traffic. And Dave? Heâ€™s enjoying a well-deserved hot cup of coffee.
